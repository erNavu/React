## Explore all the ways of writing css.
There are `three primary types` of CSS: 
1. `Inline` 
2. `Internal or Embedded`
3. `External`

`Inline styles` are written directly into the HTML element using the `style` attribute. For example:
```html
<p style="color: green; font-size: 50px; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Hello world</p>
```
`Internal or Embedded` CSS is defined within the HTML document's `<style>` element. It applies styles to specified HTML elements. For example:

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: powderblue;
  }
  .main {
    text-align: center;
  }
  .GFG {
    color: #009900;
    font-size: 50px;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  #geeks {
    font-style: bold;
    font-size: 20px;
  }
</style>
```

`External CSS` contains separate CSS files that contain only style properties with the help of tag attributes (For example class, id, heading, â€¦ etc). CSS property is written in a separate file with a `.css` extension and should be linked to the HTML document using a `link` tag. For example:
```css
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
.main {
  text-align: center;
}
.GFG {
  color: #009900;
  font-size: 50px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
#geeks {
  font-style: bold;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

Additionally, there are other ways to write CSS, such as using CSS pre-processors like `Sass or Less`, which allow you to write CSS using a more programming-like syntax.

There are also `CSS frameworks` like `Bootstrap` or `Tailwind` or `MaterialUi` CSS, which provide pre-written CSS classes to speed up development.

Another example is @media, which is used to create `media queries`:
```css
body {
  background-color: pink;
}

@media (min-width: 30em) {
  body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
}
```

##  In tailwind.config.js , what does all the keys mean (content, theme, extend, plugins)?

In `tailwind.config.js`, the keys are used to configure various aspects of Tailwind CSS. Here's a breakdown of what each key does:

1. `content `

The `content` key specifies the files and directories that Tailwind should scan for classes to include in the generated CSS. This is where you tell Tailwind which files to look at to determine which classes to generate.
```js
content: [
  './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html}',
  './components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,html}',
]
```
In this example, Tailwind will scan all files with `.js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, and .html` extensions in the `src` and `components` directories.

2. `theme`

The `theme` key is where you define the visual design of your application. This is where you set the default values for things like colors, spacing, typography, and more.

```js
theme: {
  colors: {
    primary: '#3498db',
    secondary: '#f1c40f',
  },
  spacing: {
    sm: '8px',
    md: '16px',
    lg: '24px',
  },
}
```
In this example, we're defining a custom color palette and spacing scale.

3. `extend`

The `extend` key is used to add custom values to the theme. This is where you can add new values to the existing theme without overriding the defaults.
```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      accent: '#9b59b6',
    },
  },
}
```
In this example, we're adding a new color value called accent to the existing color palette.

4. `plugins`

The `plugins` key is where you can add custom plugins to extend Tailwind's functionality. Plugins can add new features, modify existing behavior, or provide additional utility classes
```js
plugins: [
  require('tailwindcss-rtl'),
  require('tailwindcss-scrollbar'),
]
```
In this example, we're adding two plugins: `tailwindcss-rtl` for RTL (right-to-left) support and `tailwindcss-scrollbar` for custom scrollbar styles.

## Why do we have .postcssrc file?

The  `.postcssrc`  file, often named postcss.config.js, is a configuration file for PostCSS. PostCSS is a tool for transforming styles with JavaScript plugins, and it is commonly used in conjunction with build tools like webpack or parcel for processing and optimizing CSS.

example 1: 
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "tailwindcss": {}
  }
}
```
In this example, the `.postcssrc` file is configuring PostCSS to use the `tailwindcss` plugins.


example 2: 
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "autoprefixer": {},
    "cssnano": {}
  }
}
```
In this example, the `.postcssrc `file is configuring PostCSS to use the `autoprefixer` and `cssnano `plugins.

When you run PostCSS, it will automatically look for a `.postcssrc` file in the root of your project. If found, it will use the configuration defined in the file to process your CSS files.

By using a `.postcssrc` file, you can keep your PostCSS configuration separate from your build scripts and ensure consistency across your project.
